# Attendance Marker Project

This project implements a machine learning-based attendance marker system. The notebook includes data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to accurately identify attendance status.

## Features

- **Face Recognition or Feature-Based Identification:** Leveraging machine learning for accurate identification of individuals.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analysis and visualization of data to identify patterns and trends.
- **Automated Attendance Tracking:** Automatically marks attendance based on model predictions.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Assessing model performance with various metrics such as accuracy and precision.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure the following are installed:

- Python 3.8 or later
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `opencv-python`
  - Other dependencies mentioned in the notebook

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd attendance-marker
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook attendance_marker.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the steps in the notebook to:
   - Preprocess the dataset (e.g., face images or attendance logs).
   - Train and fine-tune the attendance marker model.
   - Evaluate the model's performance.
   - Use the model to mark attendance based on real-time or batch inputs.

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset of images or logs suitable for attendance marking tasks. Key attributes and target variables are detailed within the notebook.

**Sample Features:**
- Person ID or Image
- Timestamp
- Attendance Status

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values, image resizing, and encoding categorical data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Insights into feature distributions and correlations.
3. **Model Training and Testing:**
   - Employing machine learning models like Support Vector Machines, CNNs, or Decision Trees.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Using techniques like GridSearchCV to optimize model parameters.
5. **Evaluation:**
   - Computing metrics like accuracy, recall, and F1-score.

## Results

The attendance marker system achieved high accuracy in identifying and marking attendance. Detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations are available in the notebook's output sections.
